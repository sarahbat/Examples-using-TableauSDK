# TableauSDK
Various demo files related to interactions with the TableauSDK to write analysis results to the TDE

On deck:
  - Create a heatmap from point data, write to polygons in TDE
  - Spatial clustering -> points in TDE
  - Maybe some exploration of spatial statisics (Getis-Ord Gi*, LISA, etc.)

I will take requests (within limits)
